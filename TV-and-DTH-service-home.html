            What is the Use of USB Port in Tata Sky, Airtel, Videocon and Other DTH Set Top Box?


        </div>
        <div class="personal-info-material">

            <p>
                We have posted many reviews and guides about various DTH (Direct-To-Home) services available in India such as Tata Sky, Airtel Digital TV (ADTV), Dish TV, Videocon D2H, etc. We have compared Tata Sky with Dish TV and Airtel Digital TV. We have also shared secret tricks to reveal hidden Service Menus in Tata Sky, Airtel and Dish TV set top boxes.
                Ever since we started posting about DTH services, many people have asked us about mysterious USB port available on these DTH set top boxes. People regularly ask us what is the use or function of this USB port present in set top boxes? Basically USB port on a set top box is used for recording purposes. It is provided to store recordings of live programs telecasting via your set top box. Some DTH services allow customers to attach their USB drives in this USB port to play videos, songs or view photos stored on their USB drive.

            [Tata Sky and Dish TV Review] Comparison Between Two Major DTH Services in India
        </div>
        <div class="social-info-material">
            <p>
                If you are living in India, you might be aware of the fact that Tata Sky and Dish TV are the best and most popular DTH (Direct-To-Home) television service providers in India. There are a few other DTH services in India such as Airtel Digital TV, Videocon D2H, Reliance Big TV, Sun Direct, etc but Tata Sky and Dish TV are at the top of the list.

                My work doesn't allow me to stay in India but due to my health problems which I mentioned earlier, currently I'm staying in India. Some of you might be knowing that I have Tata Sky DTH connection at my home as I have posted about my interesting service menu discovery in Tata Sky STB. I have an HD+ Transfer set top box of Tata Sky which allows me to watch HD channels as well as record them. Recently I posted about hidden secret service menu present in Dish TV which I found while checking a new Dish TV connection purchased by my cousin sister. It was also an HD+ connection.

                It helped me in comparing both Tata Sky and Dish TV quality and performance. I found many differences between both the services. In some areas Tata Sky is the best but there are some features which are exclusive to Dish TV.

                Here is another exclusive article for AskVG readers. It might become very useful if you live in India and planning to switch to or purchase a new DTH (Direct-To-Home) television service provider.

                Today in this article we are going to write an exclusive review of Airtel Digital TV (ADTV) which is one of the most popular DTH service providers in India. We are also going to compare it with another popular DTH service of India which is Tata Sky.

                Tata Sky and Airtel Digital TV are very similar in hardware as well as software. Both DTH services are using quite similar hardware and both provide good picture quality. Both DTH services provide built-in hard disks to record channel programs.

                If we talk about the set top box software, its almost same in both DTH services. Actually both companies are using same software which has been developed by Cisco company in India, that's why you'll find quite similar user interface in both services.

            Revealing Hidden Secret Service Menu in Dish TV DTH Set Top Box
        </div>
        <div class="personal-info-is-used-p">
            <p>
                There are many DTH (Direct-To-Home) television service providers in India such as Tata Sky, Dish TV, Airtel Digital TV, Reliance Big TV, Videocon D2H, Sun Direct, etc and Tata Sky and Dish TV are the most popular brands among them.

                In past we have shared a secret trick to access hidden service menu in Tata Sky and Airtel Digital TV Set Top Box which allows you to setup LNB, format hard disk, perform master reset and much more
                Today its turn of Dish TV. Last week my cousin sister got a new Dish TV connection. It was an HD+ connection i.e. the set top box provides a few HD (high-definition) channels and also allows to pause, rewind, record live TV channels.

                When the service guys finished installation of dish antenna, she asked me to check the quality of new connection and adjust various built-in settings. When I was looking into menus, I found an interesting menu "Utility" present in STB Info -> Setup section. When I tried to open the menu, it asked for a password.

                I tried various password combinations such as 0000, 1234, 12345, 123456, 1111, etc but none of them worked. I was not able to access the Utility menu. I contacted Dish TV customer care and asked them about the password but as usual they had no idea about it. Then I contacted one of my friends who works in Dish TV and he told me the correct password. When I entered the password, I was able to access a hidden secret service menu in Dish TV set top box which was quite similar to Tata Sky service menu.

                So today in this article, I'm going to tell you the correct password of Utility menu present in Dish TV set top box settings which will help you in accessing a secret service menu.
